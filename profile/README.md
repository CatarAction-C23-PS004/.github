## Title of the Project 

CatarAction

## Abstract

Cataracts are a common eye disease, particularly among the elderly, which can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. This disease typically progresses slowly and leads to visual disturbances, including blurred vision, which can eventually cause blindness if left untreated. In Indonesia, cataracts are a major contributor to the country's high rate of blindness, which is the highest in Southeast Asia. According to the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) survey conducted by the Indonesian Ophthalmologist Association and Balitbangkes, cataracts account for 81 percent of all cases of blindness in Indonesia, with a national blindness rate of 3 percent.

Unfortunately, despite the significant number of cataract sufferers in Indonesia, there are only 3,000 ophthalmologists spread across the country, making early treatment quite a challenge. To address this issue, we create and develop an image recognition-based application to help identify existing cataract symptoms and provide users with helpful suggestions. By simply scanning or taking photos of their eyes, users can determine whether they have cataracts and receive guidance on how to manage their condition moving forward. This innovative solution can potentially improve access to early detection and treatment, ultimately improving the quality of life for cataract sufferers in Indonesia.
